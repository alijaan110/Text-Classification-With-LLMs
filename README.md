# Text Classification with LLMs

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for implementing text classification tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). It is ideal for handling various classification challenges, such as sentiment analysis, topic categorization, spam detection, and more. With step-by-step guides and tools, this repository is suitable for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

## Features

- **Preprocessing Pipelines**: Efficient scripts for data cleaning, tokenization, and preparation.
- **Fine-tuning LLMs**: Instructions and scripts for fine-tuning state-of-the-art models like GPT, LLaMA, and T5.
- **Inference and Deployment**: Tools to run model inference locally or deploy models via RESTful APIs.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Built-in tools for assessing model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrate with Hugging Face models or custom-trained models.

## Requirements

- Python
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers Library
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt'
